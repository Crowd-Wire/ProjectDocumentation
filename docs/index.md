# Welcome to CrowdWire

## Project Overview

CrowdWire is an open-source application that welcomes anybody that wants to contribute to our goals.
This repository aims to describe the Project Planning, Architecture and Documentation for the CrowdWire Project.

Here's the context and motivation for the application:
> With the emergence of Covid-19 all around the World, many people, companies and organizations started adopting remote procedures like video-conferences to continue doing the commons tasks they used to do "in person". Therefore, the search and use of these types of systems that allow video and voice calls has increased a lot. Most of the current video communication systems are limited in the sense that they do not provide a remote interactive environment, side conversations, nor visualization that mimics real life behaviours. To solve this issue we want to incorporate, as much as possible, this component which is one of the most rewarding thing in real life meetings. Besides this, the ones that do, are not open source projects.

The repository of CrowdWire's source code can be found at: [CrowdWire](https://github.com/Crowd-Wire/CrowdWire).
